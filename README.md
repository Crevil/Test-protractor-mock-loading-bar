# Test-protractor-mock-loading-bar
Project to test behavior with protractor-http-mock and angular-loading-bar.

When using [angular-loading-bar](http://chieffancypants.github.io/angular-loading-bar/) and [protractor-http-mock](https://github.com/atecarlos/protractor-http-mock) the loading bar does not resolve all http queries.

When running tests it resolves all transfers correct when loading bar is ignored.
